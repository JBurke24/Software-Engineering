# BlueJayDay

This is a repository for our weather dashboard. This is done by Jimmy Burke and Santiago Lizzaraga.

This application was developed on Spring Boot using Java, HTML, Javascript, and API utilization.

This code, once applied on a machine, can be ran using localhost, and will give weather descriptions for the city that the user inputs. It also shows a 5 day future forecast prediction, using our OpenWeatherMaps API.
